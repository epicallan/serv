# `serv-wai`, `Api`-type conformant Wai-compatible servers

This package offers ways to create `Application` values which conform exactly
to `Api`-types from `serv`. Moreover, by inspection of the `Api`-type we
provide automatic routing, content negotiation, and
serialization/deserialization.

## Examples of servers

For now, see the example server
[`Example.Ex1`](https://github.com/tel/serv/blob/master/serv-wai/test/Examples/Ex1.hs),
a functional example server on a single endpoint. A longer tutorial is to come.
